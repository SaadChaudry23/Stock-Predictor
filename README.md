# Stock-Predictor
Use ML and Data Science concepts to create a model that will predict the stock price for the following day to the best of its ability.

To start this project off i will just use S&P500 and train my model based of the S&P500 data. Will obviously need to clean the data and then train it.

Will need to go back testing as well to see how good this model ive trained is. and perhaps add a few more predictors to be more accurate if need be.
